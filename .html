    <h2> Introduction </h2>
  
    <p>Many of the tricks I'm going to share will be quality of life things or personal preference things. Everyone plays survival games differently so if there's a different method you prefer for your play style, by all means do it that way. I'm going to try and touch on choosing a server, fighting zombies, PvP and certain Crafting recipes, etc. This page may be updated frequently as I learn new things or updates are made to the game.</p>

    <h2> Choosing A Server </h2>
    <article>
      <p>When you first load up the menus you're going to want to hit Play which will bring you to a list full of different servers. At the top will be Livonia servers which are DLC only. Everything else will be Chernarus which is the original map. I would recommend immediately going over to the Filters panel by hitting RT, scrolling down to Region, and changing it to your local region. I'm in the US so I've changed my Region filter to "Americas". After that hit X to refresh the server list and you should now only see servers in your region. This will help your gameplay be much less laggy than if you were to play outside of your region.</p>
  
      <p>Now, a couple of things about picking a server. Once you choose a server you need to stick with the one you chose. If you switch to another server your items and character WILL carry over, but you will be moved to a different random location and be lost all over again. This is a feature meant to stop players from server hopping to take loot from multiple servers. You can favorite the server you play by hitting cn_Y on it in the list. This will put a white star next to it as shown in the image above.</p>
  
      <p>I also recommend choosing a server marked as (1st Person Only | Persistence On). This is a personal preference of mine, but playing any server that doesn't state 1st person only puts you at a huge disadvantage. When playing a standard 3rd person server many other players like to abuse the 3rd person system by using it to peek around corners /windows in buildings and ambush you. You will almost always die to someone who's been corner peeking/camping for hours waiting for someone to stroll by unaware. If you're okay with this then feel free to choose any server you'd like.</p>
  
      <p>The Persistence On indicator means that the server does not clean up certain up items when it resets every few hours. This means if another player builds a base it will stay there indefinitely until it's torn down by other players. It also means if another player drops a bunch of items or gets killed, their loot will stay on the ground for a very long time. I like Persistence On because I will sometimes come across a bunch of stuff a geared up player has dropped that is really useful for me or come across abandoned bases that still have loot stashed inside. However, Persistence On servers also have groups or clans running around on them with a base somewhere so be careful that you might run into one.</p>
  
      <p>There are Community run servers that are servers rented and paid for by players. Your progress and items from officials servers will NOT carry over to the community and the same goes for the other way around. It is possible for players to set up a community server purely for achievement hunters, but since those aren't permanent and servers are pricey, I won't be mentioning those in the walkthrough for achievements.</P>
  
      <p>You'll notice each server has a Player status that will show either Low, Medium, or High. This indicates how many players are currently on the server. 1-20 is low, 21-40 is medium, 41-60 is high. I would try and find a server that's on medium so you don't end up putting progress on a server that gets full and has you waiting for 10-20 minutes in a queue to get in.</p>

    <h2>Player vs Zombie </h2>
    <article>
      <p>Zombies will be your most common enemy you come across. Though lacking the intelligence of another player, they should still be feared all the same. One or two zombies is manageable, but a horde of them will most likely mean death to unprepared survivors. Here are a few hints to help out against them.</p>
  
      <p>All zombies are attracted to sound. If you run past them while standing up they will hear you and come after you. Zombies will not hear you if you are crouch walking or crouch sprinting. Even if you crouch run right next to them. They can however still visually see you if you walk in their field of view. Because of this I recommend taking the route that has the zombie's backs towards you so you can avoid detection if possible. Zombies can hear other zombies scream so if you are attacked by one it's possible others nearby might come as well.</P>
  
      <p>Luckily zombies do not hear doors being open or shut so you can enter a building and shut the door without alerting any surrounding infected. When I'm in a town looting I'm almost always crouched to avoid zombie detection and to make less noise for other players to hear.</P>
  
      <p>If you throw an item and it lands near a zombie they will aggro and run to investigate it and try to find the source. If you fire a gun whether it's suppressed or not, it will attract every zombie in the area to come running towards you. Be mindful of this before shooting your weapon inside a town or military base. I generally only use my weapon in PvP fights or emergency situations for this very reason. Guns are extremely loud.</P>

    <h2>Player vs Player </h2>
    <article>
      <p>Running into other players is inevitable. You're going to have to be prepared for it both in-game and mentally. I've been through a ton of PvP gunfights and I still have an absolute adrenaline dump when I come across other players. You're going to lose fights and you're going to win some. Confidence is key and just because you've been shot doesn't mean you're out of the fight. Give it everything you've got until one of you is dead.</p>
  
      <p>When you first start out you're going to come across other fresh spawn players more often. These players are very hit-or-miss in terms of aggression. Some will just t-bag the ground and run away, others will try to beat you up with their fist. It's a mixed bag. When you're a fresh spawn you have nothing to lose. You could always hold the down button and use your mic to ask if they're friendly or not. Personally I avoid other players if possible because most of them love to kill on sight on Xbox.</P>
  
      <p>There are players known as "Bandits" which are heavily geared players who travel back down to the fresh spawn areas just to kill everyone they see. This is another reason I avoid players until I've got more gear, but at the same time if you're lucky enough to kill them with an axe, a shotgun, or something else you've recently found this could jump-start your gear as they'll normally have a bunch of goodies. Your choice on that one.</P>
  
      <p>I mentioned above that crouch walking makes it so zombies can't hear you, but it also makes it harder for other players to hear you until you're close by. You can also use this same method to detect if another player is around by occasionally stopping to listen for footsteps or gear being moved around like the sound of someone switching weapons or taking things to their hands. This is why I highly recommend using some sort of headphones. Sometimes you can hear the smallest sounds of footsteps and set up an ambush because you know they're coming and they don't know you're there. The element of surprise can be a huge factor in winning a PvP battle.</p>
  
      <p>Other methods of detecting if a player is around is looking for zombies who are being aggressive towards something. Zombies will only run or scream when they're going after another player and occasionally after a wild animal, but you'll hear the animal too so it's easy to determine what the zombie is chasing. If you come into a town and see a zombie sprinting quickly towards a direction, odds are they're going after a player. This is a perfect example of why I try not to clear out places like Military bases of the surrounding zombies. That way I can loot items and use the zombies as a sort of alarm when they catch players who are trying to sneak up on me.</p>

    <h2> Bugs And Glitches </h2>
    <article>
      <p>DayZ is notorious for its bugs that can sometimes be game-breaking. Luckily most of these bugs can be fixed by logging out and logging back into the server. Most of the bugs I run into seem to start happening after looting a player's dead body.
  
        When you're looting a dead body sometimes certain items won't register that you've already picked it up. If you keep trying to take an item but it won't go to your inventory for some reason it's either bugged and you'll have to log out and come back, or it's because the item is inside a backpack or container and you'll have to take it to your hands first.
  
        Generally it's always a good idea to log out and come back after looting a dead player just in case. Make sure to check your inventory as soon as you log back in and make sure none of your items or guns glitched to the ground or into the dead player's items. Check and make sure the items you took are in your inventory as well.
  
        Other bugs that can happen is when the game sort of de-synchronizes with the servers and you'll notice that certain actions no longer work, like trying to reload a magazine, eat food, or drink water. If you notice the "progress circle" in the middle of the screen only pops up for a quick second and your interaction immediately stops then you're probably de-synced. Again you can fix this by logging out and back in.</p>

    <h2> Helpful Crafting Recipes </h2>
    <article>
      <p>Sometimes when starting out you may need to get creative until you find some proper gear or items. These are the most helpful and easiest ones to do in my opinion but by no means a full list of crafting. This game has a lot of different crafting methods that you can play around with later and even has base building, but I won't be covering that in this walkthrough.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Small Stone + Small Stone = Improvised Knife (Useful for a blade when starting out until you find a proper knife)
        </li>
        <li>Burlap Sack + Rope = Burlap Courier Bag (A simple backpack to craft with 30 inventory slots and blends in well with most environments)</li>
        <li>Burlap Courier Bag + 3 Wooden Stick = Burlap Backpack (Increases the inventory space of the Burlap bag from 30 to 42)</li>
        <li>Duct Tape + Empty Plastic Bottle = Plastic Bottle Suppressor (Fits most rifles and will last for a couple of shots)
        </li>
        <li>Bladed Weapon + Clothes = Rags (An easy way to get extra rags for bandages or kindling is by cutting up clothes)
        </li>
        <li>Bladed Weapon + Raincoat = Armbands (Wearable armbands are a great way to help you identify friends)
        </li>
        <li>Wooden Stick + Bark = Hand Drill Kit (Hand Drill Kits are a great alternative to Matches or Road Flares when you need to start a fire)
        </li>
        <li>Baseball Bat + Nails = Nailed Baseball Bat (Greatly increases damage and also causes bleeds against other players)
        </li>
        <li>Wooden Stick + Rag /Paper/bark = Fireplace (This is also explained on the Hunting section of the Hydration & Hunger Page)</li>
      </ul>
